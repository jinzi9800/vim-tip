## Included Plugins
 引用的插件
I recommend reading the docs of these plugins to understand them better. Each plugin provides a much better Vim experience!
> 为了有更好的vim体验效果，请读懂下面各个插件的介绍  
* [snipmate.vim](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate): snipmate.vim aims to be a concise vim script that implements some of TextMate's snippets features in Vim
* [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale): Syntax and lint checking for vim (async)
* [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary): Comment stuff out.  Use `gcc` to comment out a line (takes a count), `gc` to comment out the target of a motion. `gcu` uncomments a set of adjacent commented lines.
* [vim-expand-region](https://github.com/terryma/vim-expand-region): Allows you to visually select increasingly larger regions of text using the same key combination
* [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive): A Git wrapper so awesome, it should be illegal
* [vim-indent-object](https://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object): Defines a new text object representing lines of code at the same indent level. Useful for python/vim scripts
* [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors): Sublime Text style multiple selections for Vim, CTRL+N is remapped to CTRL+S (due to YankRing)
* [vim-yankstack](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/vim-yankstack): Maintains a history of previous yanks, changes and deletes
* [vim-zenroom2](https://github.com/amix/vim-zenroom2) Remove all clutter and focus only on the essential. Similar to iA Writer or Write Room

## How to include your own stuff?
> 加入你自己的东西  

After you have installed the setup, you can create **~/.vim_runtime/my_configs.vim** to fill in any configurations that are important for you. For instance, my **my_configs.vim** looks like this:
> 安装完ultimate-vim 以后你可以在
    `~/.vim_runtime (master)> cat my_configs.vim`  
    这个文件里面添加类似这样的代码做个性化

    ```
	map <leader>ct :cd ~/Desktop/Todoist/todoist<cr>
	map <leader>cw :cd ~/Desktop/Wedoist/wedoist<cr> 
    ```

You can also install your plugins, for instance, via pathogen you can install [vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails):
> 你也可以像这样增加一些插件  

    ```
	cd ~/.vim_runtime
	git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-rails.git my_plugins/vim-rails
    ```


## How to uninstall
Just do following:
* Remove `~/.vim_runtime`
* Remove any lines that reference `.vim_runtime` in your `~/.vimrc`

## it the orignal COPY up above, below it is my own stuff. Thank for the oringal code, it so great for human being!
* add dockerfile.vim at ~/.vim/my_plugins/Dockerfile.vim.
* put the tree right & let every doc could be seen.
* change the colorscheme with monokai.vim.
