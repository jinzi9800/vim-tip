This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=42

With bufexplorer, you can quickly and easily switch between buffers by using the one of the default public interfaces:

  '\be' (normal open)  or
  > 普通打开  

  '\bs' (force horizontal split open)  or
  > 水平打开  

  '\bv' (force vertical split open)
  > 垂直打开  

## 打开bufexplorer以后的操作  

1. Once the bufexplorer window is open you can use the normal movement keys (hjkl) to move around  
2. and then use <Enter> or <Left-Mouse-Click> to select the buffer you would like to open.  
3. If you would like to have the selected buffer opened in a new tab, simply press either <Shift-Enter> or 't'.
>Please note that when opening a buffer in a tab, that if the buffer is already in another tab, bufexplorer can switch to that tab automatically for you if you would like. More about that in the supplied VIM help.
