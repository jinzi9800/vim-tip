# [vim-yankstack](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/vim-yankstack)  
Maintains a history of previous yanks, changes and deletes
> 包含复制，更改和删除的记录  

 is a lightweight implementation of the Emacs 'kill ring' for Vim.  It allows you to yank and delete things without worrying about losing the text that you yanked previously. It effectively turns your default register into a stack, and lets you cycle through the items in the stack after doing a paste.

This plugin is intended to be a simpler alternative to the [yankring](https://github.com/chrismetcalf/vim-yankring) plugin. It has a fairly complete [test suite](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/vim-yankstack/blob/master/spec/yankstack/yankstack_spec.rb) based on [rspec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec) and [vimbot](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/vimbot).


## Key Mappings ##

By default, yankstack adds only 2 key bindings, in normal and visual modes:

`meta-p`  - cycle *backward* through your history of yanks  
`meta-shift-p`  - cycle *forwards* through your history of yanks  

After pasting some text using `p` or `P`, you can cycle through your yank history using these commands. Typing either of these keys *without* pasting first will do a normal paste (the same as typing `p`). This also works in insert mode.  

### the 'meta' key

If you're using MacVim, and you want to use this plugin's default key bindings (or any bindings involving the `option` key), you must `:set macmeta`. On Linux, you may have issues with the meta key if your terminal is running in 7bit mode.  
Instructions for dealing with this can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/vim-yankstack/wiki/Linux-terminal-configurations-for-correct-meta-key-handling)  

## Commands ##

You can see the contents of the yank-stack using the `Yanks`command.
Its output is similar to the `registers`command.

## Configuration ##

Yankstack defines two plugin mappings that you can map to keys of your choosing.
The same mappings work in normal and insert modes.

- `Plug>yankstack_substitute_older_paste`- cycle backwards through your history of yanks
- `Plug>yankstack_substitute_newer_paste`- cycle forwards through your history of yanks

For example, if you wanted to define some mappings based on your 'leader' key,
you could do this:

`nmap <leader>p <Plug>yankstack_substitute_older_paste
nmap <leader>P <Plug>yankstack_substitute_newer_paste
`
Also, if you want to load yankstack without the default key mappings, just` let g:yankstack_map_keys = 0 `in your .vimrc file.

## Compatibility ##Yankstack works by mapping the yank and paste keys to functions that do somebook-keeping before calling through to the normal yank/paste keys. You may wantto define your ow appings of the yank and paste keys. For example, I like tomap the `Y` key to `y$`, so that it behaves the same as `D` and`C`. The yankstack mappings need to happen **before** you efine any such
mappings of your own. To achieve this, just call `yankstack#setup()` inyour vimrc, before defining your mappings:  

```
call yankstack#setup()
nmap Y y$
" other mappings involving y, d, c, etc
```

You can also prevent certain keys from being remapped by setting the `g:yankstack_yank_keys`
to the keys of your choosing. For example, if you only want Yankstack to remap `y` and `d`:

```
let g:yankstack_yank_keys = ['y', 'd']
```
