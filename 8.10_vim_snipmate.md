snipmate.vim aims to be a concise vim script that implements some of TextMate's snippets features in Vim
> 
# [snipmate.vim](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate)  
SnipMate aims to provide support for textual snippets, similar to TextMate or other Vim plugins like [UltiSnips][ultisnips]. For example, in C, typing `for<tab>` could be expanded to

    for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        /* code */
    }

with successive presses of tab jumping around the snippet.

Originally authored by [Michael Sanders][msanders], SnipMate was forked in 2011
after a stagnation in development. This fork is currently maintained by [Rok
Garbas][garbas], [Marc Weber][marcweber], and [Adnan Zafar][ajzafar].


## Installing SnipMate ##

We recommend one of the following methods for installing SnipMate and its
dependencies. SnipMate depends on [vim-addon-mw-utils][mw-utils] and
[tlib][tlib].

> **NOTE:** SnipMate does not ship with any snippets out of the box. We suggest
looking at the [vim-snippets][vim-snippets] repository.

* Using [VAM][vam], add `vim-snippets` to the list of packages to be installed.

* Using [Pathogen][pathogen], run the following commands:

        % cd ~/.vim/bundle
        % git clone https://github.com/tomtom/tlib_vim.git
        % git clone https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-mw-utils.git
        % git clone https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate.git

        # Optional:
        % git clone https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets.git

* Using [Vundle][vundle], add the following to your `vimrc` then run
  `:PluginInstall`

        Plugin 'MarcWeber/vim-addon-mw-utils'
        Plugin 'tomtom/tlib_vim'
        Plugin 'garbas/vim-snipmate'

        " Optional:
        Plugin 'honza/vim-snippets'

## FAQ ##

> SnipMate doesn't work / My snippets aren't triggering

Try all of the following:

* Check that SnipMate is loaded. This can be done by looking for
  `<Plug>snipMateTrigger` and similar maps in the output of `:imap`.
  Additionally make sure either `<Plug>snipMateTrigger` or
  `<Plug>snipMateNextOrTrigger` is mapped to the key you expect.

* Check that the snippets file you mean to use exists, and that it contains the
  snippet you're trying to expand.

* Check that your snippets file is located inside a `foo/snippets` directory,
  where `foo` is a path listed in your `runtimepath`.

* Check that your snippets file is in scope by either the filetype matching the
  path of the snippet file or the scope explicitly loaded.

* Check if any snippets from your snippets file are available. This can be done
  with the "show available snips" map, by default bound to `<C-R><Tab>` in
  insert mode.

If all of the above check out, please open an issue stating your Vim version,
a sample snippet, and a description of exactly what happens when you try to
trigger a snippet.

> How does SnipMate determine which snippets to load? How can I separate, for
> example, my Rails snippets from my Ruby snippets?

Primarily SnipMate looks at the `'filetype'` and `'syntax'` settings. Taking
"scopes" from these options, it looks in each `snippets/` directory in
`'runtimepath'` for files named `scope.snippets`, `scope/*.snippets`, or
`scope_*.snippets`.

However we understand this may not allow for the flexibility desired by some
languages. For this we provide two options: scope aliases and the
`:SnipMateLoadScope` command. Scope aliases simply say "whenever this scope is
loaded, also load this other scope:

    let g:snipMate = get(g:, 'snipMate', {}) " Allow for vimrc re-sourcing
    let g:snipMate.scope_aliases = {}
    let g:snipMate.scope_aliases['ruby'] = 'ruby,rails'

will load the `ruby-rails` scope whenever the `ruby` scope is active. The
`:SnipMateLoadScope foo` command will always load the foo scope in the current
buffer. The [vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) plugin automatically
does `:SnipMateLoadScope rails` when editing a Rails project for example.

> What are the snippet parser versions and what's the difference between them?

Originally SnipMate used regex to parse a snippet. Determining where stops were,
what the placeholders were, where mirrors were, etc. were all done with regex.
Needless to say this was a little fragile. When the time came for a rewritten
parser, some incompatibilities were a little necessary. Rather than break
everyone's snippets everywhere, we provided both the new (version 1) and the old
(version 0) and let the user choose between them.

Version 0 is considered legacy and not a lot of effort is going to go into
improving or even maintaining it. Version 1 is the future, and one can expect
new features to only exist for version 1 users. A full list of differences can
be found in the docs at `:h SnipMate-parser-versions`.
