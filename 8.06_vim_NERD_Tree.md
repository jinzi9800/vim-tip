# [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
## Introduction  
The NERDTree is a file system explorer for the Vim editor. Using this plugin, users can visually browse complex directory hierarchies, quickly open files for reading or editing, and perform basic file system operations.

## Getting Started 快速开始  

After installing NERDTree, the best way to learn it is to turn on the Quick Help. Open NERDTree with the `:NERDTree` command, and press `?` to turn on the Quick Help, which will show you all the mappings and commands available in the NERDTree. Of course, your most complete source of information is the documentation: `:help NERDTree`.

## NERDTree Plugins
NERDTree can be extended with custom mappings and functions using its built-in API. The details of this API and are described in the included documentation. Several plugins have been written, and are available on Github for installation like any other plugin. The plugins in this list are maintained (or not) by their respective owners, and certain combinations may be incompatible.
    
* [Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin](https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin): Shows Git status flags for files and folders in NERDTree.
* [ryanoasis/vim-devicons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons): Adds filetype-specific icons to NERDTree files and folders,
* [tiagofumo/vim-nerdtree-syntax-highlight](https://github.com/tiagofumo/vim-nerdtree-syntax-highlight): Adds syntax highlighting to NERDTree based on filetype.
* [scrooloose/nerdtree-project-plugin](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree-project-plugin): Saves and restores the state of the NERDTree between sessions.
* [PhilRunninger/nerdtree-buffer-ops](https://github.com/PhilRunninger/nerdtree-buffer-ops): 1) Highlights open files in a different color. 2) Closes a buffer directly from NERDTree.
* [PhilRunninger/nerdtree-visual-selection](https://github.com/PhilRunninger/nerdtree-visual-selection): Enables NERDTree to open, delete, move, or copy multiple Visually-selected files at once.

## Frequently Asked Questions

In the answers to these questions, you will see code blocks that you can put in your `vimrc` file.

* How can I map a specific key or shortcut to open NERDTree?

NERDTree doesn't create any shortcuts outside of the NERDTree window, so as not to overwrite any of your other shortcuts. Use the `nnoremap` command in your `vimrc`. You, of course, have many keys and NERDTree commands to choose from. Here are but a few examples.
```vim
nnoremap <leader>n :NERDTreeFocus<CR>
nnoremap <C-n> :NERDTree<CR>
nnoremap <C-t> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
nnoremap <C-f> :NERDTreeFind<CR>
```

* How do I open NERDTree automatically when Vim starts?
Each code block below is slightly different, as described in the `" Comment lines`.

```vim
" Start NERDTree and leave the cursor in it.
autocmd VimEnter * NERDTree
```
---
```vim
" Start NERDTree and put the cursor back in the other window.
autocmd VimEnter * NERDTree | wincmd p
```
---
```vim
" Start NERDTree when Vim is started without file arguments.
autocmd StdinReadPre * let s:std_in=1
autocmd VimEnter * if argc() == 0 && !exists('s:std_in') | NERDTree | endif
```
---
```vim
" Start NERDTree. If a file is specified, move the cursor to its window.
autocmd StdinReadPre * let s:std_in=1
autocmd VimEnter * NERDTree | if argc() > 0 || exists("s:std_in") | wincmd p | endif
```
---
```vim
" Start NERDTree, unless a file or session is specified, eg. vim -S session_file.vim.
autocmd StdinReadPre * let s:std_in=1
autocmd VimEnter * if argc() == 0 && !exists('s:std_in') && v:this_session == '' | NERDTree | endif
```
---
```vim
" Start NERDTree when Vim starts with a directory argument.
autocmd StdinReadPre * let s:std_in=1
autocmd VimEnter * if argc() == 1 && isdirectory(argv()[0]) && !exists('s:std_in') |
    \ execute 'NERDTree' argv()[0] | wincmd p | enew | execute 'cd '.argv()[0] | endif
```

* How can I close Vim automatically when NERDTree is the last window?

```vim
" Exit Vim if NERDTree is the only window left.
autocmd BufEnter * if tabpagenr('$') == 1 && winnr('$') == 1 && exists('b:NERDTree') && b:NERDTree.isTabTree() |
    \ quit | endif
```

* Can I have the same NERDTree on every tab automatically?

```vim
" Open the existing NERDTree on each new tab.
autocmd BufWinEnter * silent NERDTreeMirror
```
or change your NERDTree-launching shortcut key like so:
```vim
" Mirror the NERDTree before showing it. This makes it the same on all tabs.
nnoremap <C-n> :NERDTreeMirror<CR>:NERDTreeFocus<CR>
```

* How can I change the default arrows?

```vim
let g:NERDTreeDirArrowExpandable = '▸'
let g:NERDTreeDirArrowCollapsible = '▾'
```
The preceding values are the non-Windows default arrow symbols. Setting these variables to empty strings will remove the arrows completely and shift the entire tree two character positions to the left. See `:h NERDTreeDirArrowExpandable` for more details.
