# [vim-indent-object](https://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object):

## Intro 说明

Vim text objects provide a convenient way to select and operate on various types of objects. These objects include regions surrounded by various types of brackets and various parts of language (ie sentences, paragraphs, etc).  

>VTO 提供了一个非常便捷的方法去选择和操作多种不同形式的对象。这些对象包括被各种括号包围的范围和语言的不同部分（比如句子和词组等）

This plugin defines a new text object, based on indentation levels. This is very useful in languages such as Python, in which the syntax defines scope in terms of indentation. Using the objects defined in this plugin, an entire if structure can be quickly selected, for example.  
> 这个插件定一个了一个新的文字对象，在缩列级的基础上。这个在python语言里面非常有用，在python语言当中，语法根据缩进定义了作用域。  

## Usage 用法

This plugin defines two new text objects. These are very similar - they differ only in whether they include the line below the block or not.  
> 这个插件定义了两种的新的文字对象，他们非常相似，区别他们唯一的办法依赖于是否他们在块下面引用这条线
> 我还不会python ，这个翻译的有点问题。
| Key bindings | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<count>ai`  | **A**n **I**ndentation level and line above.                |
| `<count>ii`  | **I**nner **I**ndentation level (**no line above**).        |
| `<count>aI`  | **A**n **I**ndentation level and lines above/below.         |
| `<count>iI`  | **I**nner **I**ndentation level (**no lines above/below**). |

**Note:**

the `iI` mapping is mostly included simply for completeness, it is effectively a synonym for `ii`.  

Just like regular text objects, these mappings can be used either with operators expecting a motion, such as `d` or `c`, as well as in visual mode.  

In visual mode the mapping can be repeated, which has the effect of iteratively increasing the scope of indentation block selected. Specifying a count can be used to achieve the same effect.
